## 案情背景|Background

* 范坡坡导演于2012年创作的同性恋纪录片，名为《彩虹伴我心》，讲述母亲如何接纳孩子性取向的故事。但是2014年12月，这部纪录片在视频网站全部下架。据相关视频网站称，是广电总局的文件通知删除该纪录片，而在范坡坡联系广电总局后得到回复称并不存在屏蔽纪录片的情况。

* In December 2014, Mama Rainbow suddenly disappeared from Chinese streaming sites. Fan was told by streaming sites Youku Tudou and 56.com that they had removed the film at the request of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) .

  

## 法律程序|Legal Process

- 2015年2月12日，导演范坡坡向广电总局寄出信息公开申请信询问删除理由。
- Fan made an official inquiry to SAPPRFT in February 2015, but the media regulator responded that it had no record of making such a request. 



- 2015年9月8日，范坡坡委托其代理律师王振宇向第一中级人民法院递交了诉讼材料，向法院提出四项请求：确认被诉答复违法；撤销被诉答复；限期被告重新作出答复，向原告公开相关政府信息；被告承担诉讼费。

- Fan filed a lawsuit against them in September 2015, an action that was widely reported by international media. 

  

- 法院于2015年9月14日正式立案。12月22日，北京第一中级人民法院对导演范坡坡起诉广电总局一案做出一审判决，认定广电总局对于下架范坡坡导演的同性恋题材纪录片《彩虹伴我心》的公开回复违法，同时驳回了范坡坡的其它诉讼请求，广电总局支付诉讼费用50元。这是中国第一起起诉广电总局获立案并认定总局违法的案子。范坡坡拿到判决书后在社交媒体上表示，简单说胜诉其实也不准确，用律师的话说“赢了一半”。法院判决“国家新闻出版广电总局”违法的原因在于答复的主体不对，本来应为“总局”，而实际回复加盖公章为“总局办公厅综合处”；针对总局的具体回复内容，法院则肯定其合理性。也就说法院认可总局并没有相关文件屏蔽我的视频。

- In December 2015, Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court ruled that SAPPRFT was correct in stating that it hadn't released any document calling for the film to be taken down.The case was seen as an important victory by LGBT activists. “I still think the verdict is to my advantage, because now knowing the agency did not release any document, I can require the video sites to put my film back," Fan stated at the time, although as of October 2018, it has not been restored. Fan has continued to be vocal about censorship of his work, speaking out against Facebook for removing queer content.
