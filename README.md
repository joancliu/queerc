* [中文版](./README_CN.md)

In the last few years, LGBT+ people in China witnessed highs and lows, or we have developed a new perspective on how to views. There are times when you sow, plough and harvest. Hope the seeds they sowed and ploughed in the past few years, will give them a plentiful harvest in the future. Here is a map or list of queer's act in China.
